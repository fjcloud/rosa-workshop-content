    ```bash
    cat <<EOF | oc apply -f -
    apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
    kind: ArgoCD
    metadata:
      name: argocd
    spec:
      dex:
        openShiftOAuth: true
      rbac:
        defaultPolicy: "role:readonly"
        policy: "g, system:authenticated, role:admin"
        scopes: "[groups]"
      server:
        insecure: true
        route:
          enabled: true
          tls:
            insecureEdgeTerminationPolicy: Redirect
            termination: edge
    EOF
    ```


1. Wait for ArgoCD to be ready

    ```bash
    kubectl rollout status deploy/argocd-server
    ```

1. Apply the gitops configuration

    ```bash
    cat <<EOF | oc apply -f -
    apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
    kind: Application
    metadata:
      name: bgd-app
      namespace: bgd
    spec:
      destination:
        namespace: bgd
        server: https://kubernetes.default.svc
      project: default
      source:
        path: apps/bgd/base
        repoURL: https://github.com/rh-mobb/gitops-bgd-app
        targetRevision: main
      syncPolicy:
        automated:
          prune: true
          selfHeal: false
        syncOptions:
        - CreateNamespace=false
    EOF
    ```

1. Find the URL for your Argo CD dashboard and log in using your OpenShift credentials

    ```bash
    oc get route argocd-server -n bgd -o jsonpath='{.spec.host}{"\n"}'
    ```

1. Verify that OpenShift sees the Deployment as rolled out

    ```bash
    oc rollout status deploy/bgd
    ```

1. Get the route and browse to it in your browser

    ```bash
    oc get route bgd -n bgd -o jsonpath='{.spec.host}{"\n"}'
    ```

1. You should see a green box in the website like so

1. Patch the OpenShift resource to force it to be out of sync with git

    ```bash
    oc patch deploy/bgd --type='json' \
      -p='[{"op": "replace", "path":
      "/spec/template/spec/containers/0/env/0/value", "value":"blue"}]'
    ```

1. Refresh Your browser and you should see a blue box in the website like so

    ![](../assets/images/app_blue.png)

1. Meanwhile check ArgoCD it should show the application as out of sync. Click the Sync button to have it revert the change you made in OpenShift
